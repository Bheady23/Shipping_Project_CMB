# Shipping_Project_CMB
This is a MySQL database created as the final project for CS300ON Bellarmine University Fall 2022.
It represents a fictional fictional shipping company that owns ships, containers and ports and want a database to keep track of all of their assets. This project demonstrates my ability to use DDL and DML language to create, implement and dervie queries from a MYSQL database.
